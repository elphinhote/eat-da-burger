## Description
Eat-Da-Burger a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.


Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
